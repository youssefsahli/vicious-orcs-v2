game::lose
    With your death the village would seem to have lost its last hope.
    Vicious orcs will no doubt soon raze and ruin your ancestral home.

game::victory
    Filled with shame and regret, you wander around the village subsisting 
    on stored food.  Eventually, the passes do clear.  And outsiders
    come to the village.  You had noble plans of turning yourself in;
    but change your mind when you see the shock and horror on the faces
    of the first newcomers.

    Nonetheless, by the following winter, you have been hunted down
    and killed.

game::cleanvictory
    What a quixotic quest the opening of the cave has led you on!

    Right down to the deepest parts of the earth, only to return
    back to your home!

    While no orcs were found, the adventure did prove quite profitable,
    both for you and your fellow villagers.  When the passes open in
    the spring the first merchants are surprised at the spendthrift
    habits of this formerly penny pinching village.

game::killorc
    As the last of the vicious orcs falls to the earth, a sharp pain
    lances through your head.

    Your vision goes white.

    The world fades back in - first in monochrome, and then with added colour.
    As you begin to make sense of what is before you, a feeling of unease
    transforms inexorably to horror.

    You may now declare your [v]ictory over the vicious orcs.

    Have fun!

mob::fletcher
    While the village fletcher has a house on the outskirts, she
    spends most of her time in the woods hunting game and fashioning arrows.
    Her skill in both bow construction and archery are well established
    and she usually sells some of her winter craftings to the first merchants.

mob::smith
    The village smith is always described as a hardworking man of virtue when
    outsiders come to purchase the village's wares.  But locals know him as one
    who spends most of the winter drinking rather than fashioning a backlog of
    goods to sell with the first merchants.  Each year, when the passes
    clear, the smith is forced into a frenzy of activity to have something to
    show for the winter of indolence.

mob::elder
    Elder is more of a job title than a description - the village elder is
    actually not that old in absolute terms.  Mind you, from your vantage
    point of youth, she is positively ancient.  Nonetheless, her sound
    judgment and levelheadedness has won the respect of the village.

mob::healer
    The village healer is actually an outsider.  He was a high paid surgeon in
    the capital when, during a routine trade mission, he was trapped in the
    village over a winter.  The following spring he closed his practice in the
    capital and moved here.  He claims it is due to the calming isolation.  The
    gossips of the village are convinced a love affair is involved,
    but to everyone's dismay, no one has yet determined the identity
    of the lover.

mob::farmer
    The backbone of these remote mountain villages: the hard working farmers
    that toil in the fields to provide the grain.  Their output not only feeds
    the village, but provides the primary export for trade.  While this fertile
    valley is isolated for most of the year by the snow covered passes, in the
    summer the cold lingers only in the mountaintops, allowing for a
    surprisingly long growing season.

mob::You
    When the earthquake revealed the mysterious cave into the
    mountains, it was only you who was willing to step up to the
    challenge from the time of legends.  The other villagers either
    believed the legends untrue, or felt it best to fight the orcs
    when they come out, rather than seeking them in their lair.

    It is thus a lonely quest - indeed, in a moment of noble self
    reflection, you realize that if you are successful, no one will
    even have proof that there was a danger!  Perhaps you should bring
    back some scalps?

mob::bat
    The erratic flight pattern of bats has often caused them to be
    associated with madness.  However, one may be surprised to know
    that there is a purpose behind it.

    In this case, the purpose seems to be to feast on your flesh.
    
mob::rat
    Cowardly rats flee at the first sign of trouble.  Beware of
    cornering them, however, for a cornered rat does not mind fighting
    unfair.

mob::kobold
    Kobolds are small purple furred dog-like creatures.  While an
    individual kobold poses little threat, their use of ranged weapons
    can wear down an adventurer.

mob::slime
    A greenish puddle of slime.  To your shock, it moves!

    Organic matter that chances to contact it as it slithers forward
    sizzles, suggesting the slime is highly acidic in nature.  Just
    when you conclude that you'll destroy it from afar with ranged
    weapons, it stretches out... and divides into two!

    Now there are two slimes to kill.

mob::spider
    This creature is certainly quite big for a spider.  But its half meter
    girth fails to inspire you with much fear.  It seems still eminently
    squashable.

    The fangs, on the other hand, remind you that spiders much, much, smaller
    can prove lethal.

mob::icebeast
    Ferocious creatures from the arctic wastes.  Beware the icy grasp!
    Or find yourself frozen in your tracks.

mob::lich
    Powerful wizards can make diabolical pacts with the devil to
    return after death as a lich.  NEVER confuse these with lichen!

mob::yeti
    Stories from climbers of the icy peaks that surround your village
    have given you a healthy respect for these furred humanoids.
    You are not sure what they are doing so far underground.  Hopefully
    it is a sign that you have almost reached the other end of the
    tunnel.

mob::dragon
    The mythical dragon is well known in literature.  
    
    This dragon does not conform to the myths you were told.

    It is shiny white in colour and the ground it stands on is covered
    with frost, as if it were radiating cold rather than heat.  While
    this is hopeful sign that it doesn't breathe fire, one should keep
    in mind that fire isn't the only thing that can be a breath weapon...

mob::orc
    The filthy green skinned orcs of legend!  These vile beasts are
    said to have decimated the village generations ago, leaving none
    alive to tell the tale.  Well, one presumes, someone must have
    escaped to describe them?  Still, it is a shock to see legend
    made flesh!  Hopefully your quest in the dungeons has prepared
    you to deal with them.

item::gold coin
    The Citran gold mark has been the universal currency of the land
    for centuries.  When this type of coin was first minted at the
    height of the Orange Age some merchants refused to accept them.
    They claimed they were not pure gold but some inferior amalgam.
    Proof of this was simple - the density of gold is such that no
    human could carry a thousand gold pieces in their pocket!  And yet
    this was possible with the Citran gold mark.

    The Citran mint calmly explained that it was not their coin that
    was debased, but rather natural gold.  They countered the heavy
    weight of natural gold was proof it was insufficiently pure.

    Pragmatic merchants sided swiftly with the mint and the Citran
    gold mark has been the unit of exchange ever since.

item::corpse
    The mangled remains of a former foe.  You have heard stories
    of dungeon adventurers that grew so hungry they were forced to
    eat such raw carrion.  You hope you will escape that fate.

item::body
    The mangled remains of a former friend.  

item::sausages
    A string of plump red sausages, well aged by their stint in these
    caves.  

item::bread
    At first you mistook it for a rock.  Then you saw it was a thick crusted
    loaf of bread.  Some gourmets would no doubt have preferred the rock.

item::mushrooms
    A bunch of mushrooms.  Edible?  Maybe.  You never know with
    mushrooms.  Even if you fed it to a kobold, you'd still
    have to wait a week or so to see if it proved toxic.  And you'd
    still not know if it was some natural kobold immunity rather than
    the safety of the mushroom.

item::apple
    A nice winter apple.  You wonder how it made its way underground.

item::pickle
    A cucumber that had been immersed in a brine solution until it
    pickled.

item::onyx ring
    The jet black onyx reflects the sterling silver setting of this ring.

item::citrine ring
    A large orange citrine is set between a circle of amethysts, making for a
    pleasing contrast in quartz.

item::diamond ring
    Diamonds, being the hardest material, are quite useful for scratching
    out blazes on the stone walls of the dungeon.  You hope the setting
    will prove sturdy enough.

item::saphire ring
    This pale blue gem reminds you of the summer sky: just before a storm.

item::aquamarine ring
    While this, almost be definition, is supposed to remind you of the ocean,
    it doesn't.  Possibly because you have never seen the ocean.

item::malachite ring
    An irregular, unpolished, lump of malachite is set in this ring.  You
    wonder what aesthetic prompted the jewler to use this green stone
    unfinished?

item::gold ring
    A plain band of gold.  A quick scratch test suggests it may have
    significant purity.  Not as pure as a Citran gold mark, of course: it is
    much too heavy, for one!

item::emerald ring
    A leaf-green emerald is set in thick copper band.  The natural oxidization
    of the copper has led to a pleasingly sylvan effect.

item::ruby ring
    This ring's gem glows bloody red in the twilight of the dungeon.

item::ring of cold resistance
    This magical ring produces a warming aura that lessens all cold based
    damage.

item::ring of cold vulnerability
    Some bumbling apprentice inverted the magic weaves of a cold resistance
    ring, resulting in this abomination.  Rather than dispose of it properly,
    he just threw it in the trash.  Where, after many an adventure, it ended up
    on the dungeon floor for you to mistakenly wear.

item::ring of acid resistance
    This ring provides a powerful neutralizing field that reduces all acidic
    damage.

item::ring of acid vulnerability
    When attempting to form troublesome solutions, rings of acid vulnerability
    are sought after to avoid premature precipitate.  They are not so sought
    after by adventurers facing slimes, however.

item::ring of deflection
    Ranged attacks need not be feared by those with a deflection ring.  They
    will be repulsed by the magic of the ring, leaving much less power for
    damaging the bearer.

item::magnetic ring
    Most sporting associations have banned the magnetic ring.  Its ability to
    help redirect thrown projectiles toward the caster makes it very useful for
    any endeavour involving catching objects.  Note that arrows, however, are
    not so simple to catch.

item::ring of searching
    The useful cantrip embedded in this ring causes it to vibrate whenever the
    surroundings are not quite what they seem.  This results in a seemingly
    psychic ability to discover traps and secret doors.
    
item::ring of poison resistance
    The energies of this ring strengthen your constitution allowing you to
    withstand toxins that would otherwise leave you dead.

item::ring of poison vulnerability
    After the homeopathic practicing mage has diluted their giant spider venom
    one to ten million, they will then don this ring to increase the effect.

    Surprisingly few have bothered to point out that the principles of
    homeopathy suggest that a poison resistance ring might be a better choice.

item::heal potion
    The succour of many an adventurer!  The powerful draught will
    instantly bind your wounds and restore your health.

item::cure potion
    While poison weakens slowly, it weakens inexorably.  A wise adventurer will
    not wait out the effect, but instead reach for a trusty cure potion for
    relief.

    Cure potions are in high demand around university campuses for their
    anti-hangover properties.

item::poison potion
    No doubt the alchemist that concentrated the vile essences that
    form this poisonous brew had some practical application in mind.
    Now if only they had bothered to affix a label to warn would be
    imbibers!

item::fruit juice
    A delicious fruit medley vacuum sealed to preserve freshness!

    There's no rotten fruit juice in *this* dungeon!  We have standards, we do!

item::acid potion
    The fuming liquid in this bottle is likely Aqua Fortis, if not even Aqua
    Regia itself!  In any case, it is something to be handled with care.
    
    Acid potions are in high demand around university campuses, though
    when asked, few will admit to purchasing them.

item::speed potion
    This powerful energizing drink is made with caffeine, sugar,
    methamphetamine, and a bit of nicotine for good measure.  It is a
    very good idea to stay within the recommended daily dosage!

    During exam sessions speed potions are sold out in the apothecaries
    around university campuses.

item::red potion
    A small glass bottle filled to the brim with a bright red liquid.
    Considering what else you find in the dungeon, it is reassuring
    that the colour is not at all that of blood.

item::yellow potion
    An opaque yellow liquid fills this square shaped bottle.  It is
    well known that yellow potions are heal potions.  So drink up!

item::blue potion
    This watery potion is tinged blue.  A greenish sediment has
    precipitated from it.

item::white potion
    The opaque white liquid in this potion remind you more of lead paint
    than it does of milk.

item::green potion
    The viscous green sludge in this potion bottle looks like the sort
    of thing you'd have to eat rather than drink.

item::teal potion
    The next time someone asks you what colour "teal" is, you plan
    on showing them the liquid of this potion bottle.

item::arrow
    A well-crafted arrow.  Unfortunately, with the hard surfaces of
    the rock caves, likely only good for one shot.

item::Hasted
    Your metabolism is running in overtime.  All the other creatures
    seem to be moving slower than before, giving you more time to
    move, attack, and escape.

item::Blinded
    You can't see!  All is black, no matter how widely you open
    your eyes.  You pray fervently that this condition is temporary.

item::Enraged
    You see red!  Your blood boils as you contemplate the crime that
    has occurred!  Vengence be thine!

item::Poisoned
    Some noxious substance courses through your veins.  With every heartbeat
    you can feel it spread and weaken you still farther.  Will your
    constitution prove strong enough to withstand the full course of
    this toxin?  Perhaps it is best to not find out.

item::Sick
    You have a bad cough that would keep you awake at nights.  But it isn't
    night yet, so I guess it is premature to describe it as that.

item::Slow
    You feel like you are wading through a thick mud.  Even your sword
    swings seem to move slower than they should.

item::crude bow
    A simple wooden bow.  Note that a bow isn't much use without arrows.

item::short bow
    This bow is well constructed.  However, its draw weight is rather low,
    preventing it from achieving the sort of power that you would prefer.

item::long bow
    This large bow has a long draw which gives it an excellent range and
    stopping power.

item::yew long bow
    Exactly why yew trees make for the best long bows is something you
    are very unclear of.  But this one has a carefully engraved label
    attesting to the genuine nature of said tree that went into its
    construction, so clearly there must be some advantage.

    In any case, a bit of practice shows it is superior to the other long
    bows you have found, independent of the name of its material.

item::kitchen knife
    While some may laugh at the prospect of a brave adventurer storming
    underground lairs armed with something from the kitchen, they
    haven't seen this knife.  Not only is it well-weighted and of a good
    length, the edge has been kept razor sharp.

    As an added bonus, you've had a lot of experience with it, if only
    in peeling potatoes.

item::crude stone dagger
    A stone dagger.  Calling it crude seems implied by the nature of
    the material, but you feel the prefix is justified in this case.
    Nonetheless, it does provide a pleasing upgrade over kitchen cutlery.

item::bronze short sword
    This pointed short sword is well-crafted and balanced.  Sadly,
    the crafter decided to use bronze, a soft metal that does not
    hold as fine an edge as you'd prefer.  Still, it beats stone!

item::iron-shod staff
    This hard wood staff has been banded by thick iron rings.  These both
    balance the weight and ensure that powerful impacts do not split the wood.
    As an added bonus it makes an excellent walking stick.

item::short sword
    The rust marks on this sword show it to be made of iron.  While this
    is an improvement on bronze, its edge still needs frequent honing.

item::mace
    This metal club is made out of some sort of blued steel.  It is heavy and
    well weighted.

item::long sword
    This long sword is made of well-tempered steel.  Its edge
    is true and sharp and promises to mean the doom of many of your foe.

item::warhammer
    A heavy hammer of black iron.  It matters not how thick the armour is:
    you will crush them with this!

item::crystal sword
    This two handed sword is clear as glass.  Beautiful rainbows spray from its
    prismatic surface when exposed to the sun.  Surprisingly, it is as hard as
    diamond.  It is fortunate that the hilt is made of base metal, or the
    village smith would have no chance of repairing it!

item::clothes
    These are your simple every day work clothes.  While certainly more modest
    than running about naked, the protection they offer is minimal at best.
    
item::leather armour
    Plates of hardened leather form the shell of this set of armour.  While it
    is in good condition, it must be resized to fit your frame.

item::studded leather armour
    The hardened leather that makes up this armour has been further
    augmented with numerous metal rivets.  While people may debate
    how much of a contribution this will make to the defensive qualities,
    it is of your opinion that they vastly improve the aesthetic.

item::ring mail
    This is a set of leather armour.  Rather than studs, however, large
    black-iron loops have been stitched onto the armour.  While they provide
    little protection for a well placed thrust, you may take comfort that they
    will easily block the wild slashes of genuine battle.

item::chain mail
    Large links of metal are woven into tunic and leggings.  While the links
    are small enough to stop most weapons, when first found the number of
    broken links seemed to almost outnumber the whole links.

item::breast plate
    A shining piece of gold-chased breast plate. No doubt lost by some noble in
    a war long ago.  While the rest of the pieces would be appreciated, the
    safety of a steel shell around your vitals is well appreciated.

item::platemail
    Breast plate and leggings fashioned with overlapping plates of steel, this
    armour provides excellent protection against almost all attacks.  Such
    a precision piece of armour requires sizing for each user, however, so
    it isn't something you can don as soon as you find it on the dungeon floor.

item::full platemail
    This set of platemail also includes the helmet, gauntlets, and all the
    other miscellenous fiddly bits whose names escape you.  This leaves
    few if any ways for enemy attacks to get through to you.

item::book of secrets
    This book is bound with brittle leather and covered with brownish-red
    stains.

    Carefully reading through what text survives:

    ...passage between the realms secured...

    ...peace negotiations betrayed...

    ...should have attacked first...

    ...the books of magic will be hidden in the passage...

    ...[m]editate on the small island to regain mana...

    ...great cost to magic...

    ...if no mana remains, your own blood will power the spell...

item::book of transmigration
    The edge of this book has been cut off as if by an infinitely sharp blade.
    Fortunately the text survives.

    It describes how to cast a spell that will link two disjoint points
    in space with a magic portal, allowing one to quickly travel between
    them.  Focus your energies into a [z]ap of this spell and direct
    it onto a suitably flat wall.

item::book of conflagration
    Between the charred pages of this tome you find instructions for
    violently releasing your magical powers as an incendiary fireball.
    The designer of the spell was even considerate enough to ensure the
    ensuing inferno does not burn yourself, even if you target too close
    in the heat of battle.

item::book of rectification
    This precisely bound grimoire details how to use your magical
    energies to mend your own body.  Obviously, when casting this spell,
    you can't use your own blood energy!

item::book of incineration
    This pristine book smells of charcoal and sulphur.

    Opening it, you discover the dread magic of incineration.  The
    explosion of flame generated by this incantation will make the
    potent fireball look like a birthday candle.

    Now all you need is a suitable target!

item::book of silence
    This is what appears to be an ancient journal.  Most of the pages are
    ripped, charred, or blurred by blood.  What you can read is this:

    ...the orc's use of dark magic...

    ...try fire with fire?...

    ...all is lost!

room::loot
    As you walk through this room something catches your eye!

    Investigating, you discover an old book among the detritus of the 
    dungeon.  You eagerly open the book and read what is inside.

room::finalquake
    A powerful earthquake shakes the cavern around you!

    Rocks fall from the ceiling and block your return path.  It seems it is
    time for your final push!  Leave no orc behind to dig the way out!

shop::healer
     Welcome to my hospice, child!

     I would gladly heal you for free 
     if you would give your word not 
     to venture back into that cave.  
    
     But there is no point to lead you 
     into temptation.  Instead, I shall 
     compromise.  I will not try to stop 
     your sorties provided you pay for 
     treatment up front!

shop::smith
     Welcome to my forge!

     Not much need for weapons and
     armour here, so I have none for
     sale.  But if you should find
     any broken, I can repair it for
     you.

     I will need to charge for the cost
     of materials, however!

shop::fletcher
     Welcome to my humble abode!

     I have plenty of arrows for sale.
     I suspect you'll need them, it
     is best to attack monsters before
     they get to you.

     I can also repair any bows that
     you may find broken in the caves.

shop::elder
     Welcome my wayward 'adventurer'.

     So you seek to disturb what I advise
     should be left undisturbed?  Well,
     such is the privilege of youth.
    
     Do not compound your folly!  Listen
     to what I have to tell you of the
     dangers you may face.

gossip::intro
    As you know from your own experience, a few weeks ago we were all awakened
    by a powerful earthquake.  Caught up with the effort of fixing the damaged
    buildings, it was only a few days ago that our fletcher found the cave.

    It appears to be very deep.  The air is not stagnant, suggesting there are
    other openings.  Rats and other vermin were reported,.

    What you know only from rumour is the legends.  According to our secret
    village histories (secret from outsiders, not from you or I, of
    course) many generations ago we faced a desperate battle.  Vicious
    orcs had streamed out of a cave in the mountains.  Only after
    great dint of battle were they repulsed.  The cave was collapsed.
    And we have lived in peace ever since.

    Now there is no reason to suppose this is the same cave complex.  Or that
    the orcs are still at the other end.  Or that the legend is even true!
    Thus, prudence states that we should guard the cave until spring opens us
    to foreign travel.  We will then ask for help from an 'adventurer'.  Let
    them take the risk, and we can enjoy the profit of overcharging for
    supplies.

    But, I see, your heart is set.  You see yourself as an adventurer.
    Take care.  Do not let your eyes be clouded by easy riches.

gossip::meditate
    Surely you recall the sacred isle?  The one at the end of the path
    next to the smith's forge?  Where you took your oath on your name
    day to respect the rules of the village?

    It is a spot of great power for our village, so must always
    be treated with respect and decorum.

    The pass should be starting to clear.  But it is not!  Normally
    I would not fret - we have enough food stockpiled to last us until
    midsummer.  But with this cave looming at the edge of our village?

    The sooner we can get some real adventurers here, the better.  It
    seems, however, that at this rate you have little fear of competition
    for a long time.

gossip::sickness
    Our healer has been busy of late!  An increasing number of villagers 
    have been falling ill.  With first planting under way, this is not a 
    good time to have our farmers sick.

    Some suspect a deadly miasma escaping from the cave is to blame.
    Please keep your eyes open while traveling in there - if you
    can find a cause, perhaps our healer can find a cure?

gossip::cold
    I fear there may be something to the legends of the cave.  This
    cold is definitely not natural.  The weather signs and portents,
    which I have learned to auger well, did not call for this sudden
    onslaught of cold!

    The farmers are particularly worried.  If a strong frost were to
    occur we could lose all the seedlings in the field!

    I know I objected to your adventure, but it seems you may have been
    right - I can only hope now that you'll fix the source of this
    unnatural cold.

gossip::orcs
    I did warn you that this cave is most likely unrelated to the cave of
    legend!

    It also should not surprise you over much to end up where you
    started, with the way twisted subterranean passages work.  I am
    just happy you ended up somewhere safe.

    Though, if you wish, I'm sure I could invent some moral message here.
    About how no matter how far you travel you will always be at home?

    Not interested?  I thought not.

    But do enjoy your gold and [v]ictory!  You have earned it.
