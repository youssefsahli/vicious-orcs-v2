  ABOUT
===========================

An earthquake has revealed a mysterious cave in the mountains
surrounding your village.  Legend has it that within lives a tribe
of vicious orcs!  Your task: preemptively protect the village.
And maybe make a few coins on the side.

===========================
  HOW TO RUN
===========================

If you are a windows user, run it from windows/orc.exe.

If you are a linux user, run it from linux/orc.sh.

If you are a source diver, go into the src directory.
Look for BUILD.TXT files to try and guide you, there is one under
each of the porting subdirectories.

Movement is done with the number pad or with vi style keys.  You

  CUSTOMIZING 
===========================

If you don't like the default font, you can change it!

Go to the windows directory and replace terminal.png with another font
compatible with The Doryen Library.

If you don't like the music, you can edit orc.cfg to point to
another file of your choosing.  You can also disable the music.

===========================
  ARTISTIC MESSAGE
===========================

The role of the author in imbuing a work with an artistic message
is often a contentious issue.  Some would say the author has no
place in determining what you take from the game.

As a compromise, I've hooked up a random number generator to dump
a suitable artistic message once you have won the game.  (Being
a roguelike, leaving the message in the hands of the RNG does
have a certain symmetry.)
